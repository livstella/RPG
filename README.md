# Java RPG game

Console application with characters who can equip weapons and armor.


## Installation
You need a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed to run this program.

## Usage
You need IntelliJ or a similar IDE to run the code.
With the IDE, run Main in the src folder.

## Items
In assignment requirement, a list of items, both weapons and armor, should be created.
Due to time constrains, not all items classes has been created. As proof of concept, Axe has been created for the weapons class and Cloth for the Armor class.

## Test
In assignment requirement, it is specified that all character classes must be tested.
Due to time constrains, only the mage class is currently being tested - as proof of concept.
These test can be run using JUnit5 in the test folder.
